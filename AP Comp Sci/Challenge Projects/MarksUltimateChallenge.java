/*
* The goal of Mark's Ultimate Challenge is to write
* a game that makes the user enter numbers in order from 1 up.
* If the user types a number that is NOT 1 above the previous number,
* the game resets to 1.  The user should quit by typing 1000.
* Begin with the starter code below.  Special thanks to Mark Hewitt'17!
